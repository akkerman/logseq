#+title: Ordered Categories

- preorder :: a [[id:65ef0e5c-8864-4f80-b92f-1c7ec0d560d2][Category]] where the morphism are relations of being less than or equal ≤.

- partial order :: a preorder where if a ≤ b and b ≤ a then a = b.

- linear order ::  a any two objects are in a relation with each other

- total order ::  see linear order

You may have cycles in a preoder but not in a partial order. Only partial and
total orders can be sorted by an [[roam:algorithm]] like [[roam:quick-sort]],
[[roam:bubble sort]], [[roam:merge sort]].
