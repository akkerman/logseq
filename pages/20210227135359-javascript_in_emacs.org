* TODO quickly/fuzzy find files
=SPC SPC= opens a search within the project files, however new files cannot be found. How to update cache?

** create project
- Add project directory to the cache
  =M-x projectile.. ?=
- Open project
  =SPC p p=
- Open file in project
  =SPC SPC=
- Clear project cache (when new file added)
   =???? SPC p i=

* TODO look into sessions
=SPC q S= and =SPC q L= will save and load sessions

When persp-mode is active, =doom-buffer-list= becomes workspace-restricted. You can overcome this by using buffer-list.

* TODO javascript snippets
* TODO Add .todo( and .skip( as todo

works not yet

* DONE open new tab
CLOSED: [2021-02-23 Tue 21:14]
=C-t= works while in orgmode but not in javascript?
=:tabe= doesn't work at all
=gt and gT= for next and previous tab work, it's confusing with a number

emacs has a concept called workspaces

Switch to the workspaces with meta and a number e.g.: =m-1=, =m-2= etc.

=SPC TAB n=
