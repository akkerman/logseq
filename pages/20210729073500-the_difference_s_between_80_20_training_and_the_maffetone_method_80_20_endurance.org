| Is there a place for moderate- and high-intensity training? | Only in the last few weeks before competition.              | Yes! Up to 20% of training is done at these intensities throughout the training cycle                           |
| How is low intensity defined?                               | Through a one-size-fits-all heart rate formula of 180 – age | Through validated field or lab tests aimed at pinpointing an individual athlete’s current ventilatory threshold |
