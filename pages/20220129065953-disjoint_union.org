#+title: disjoint union

One creates a disjoint union of two sets by creating a set of tuples from two other sets where one element of the tuple is the original value from the original set and the other element of the tuple is a tag so it can be traced back to the original set.

Consider the sets A_0 = {5, 6, 7} and A_1 = {5, 6}, it is possible to index the set elements according to set origing by forming the associated sets
A*_0 = {(5,0), (6,0), (7,0)}
A*_1 = {(5,1), (6,1)}
where the second element in each pair matches the subscript of the origin set. The disjoint union A_0 ⨆ A_1 can then be calculated as follows

A_0 ⨆ A_1 = A*_0 ∪ A*_1 = {(5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (5,1), (6,1)}
