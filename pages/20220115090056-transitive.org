#+title: transitive relation

When a relation or [[id:5070516e-6dc7-4c8b-b69e-45db03c10be2][binary operation]] is transitive it means that if there is a
relation from some element a to b /and/ there is a  relation from b to c /then/
there must also be a relation from a to c.

In a [[id:65ef0e5c-8864-4f80-b92f-1c7ec0d560d2][Category]] transitivity is defined as the composition of morphisms.

examples:

|       | and   | yields |
|-------+-------+--------|
| a < b | b < c | a < c  |
| a = b | b = c | a = c  |
| a ≥ b | b ≥ c | a ≥ c  |


A [[roam:Logical Implication]] is also transitive.
