#+title: Why, in Logic, Does “False” Imply Anything?

False implies True, True implies True

If you translate to set theory and think of implies as 'is a subset of'.
Then when you say: 'if it rains' -> 'the grass gets wet' you mean

The set of time that it rains is a subset of times the grass is wet.
Since the empty set is a subset of any set, a false statement implies any statement.
